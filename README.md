# CHATCHW Knowledge Management Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the centralized documentation, references, planning materials, and knowledge-management assets for the **CHATCHW Research Team**, led by Professor Levine. Its purpose is to maintain an organized, accessible, and version-controlled hub for all project-related materials, including PDFs, Google Docs exports, spreadsheets, agendas, procedures, and reference documents.

## Purpose
The CHATCHW project explores community health worker (CHW) applications, system design, research planning, and operational coordination. This repository ensures that all team members can easily access structured project knowledge.
